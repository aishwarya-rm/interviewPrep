Dictionaries and Sets are essentially the same ADT that has the following methods:
insert
Find
delete

These are really good, because we want to access elements quickly and we won't often access
many of the elements. For example, an array is useful because it has O(1) lookup at a particular index.
But often times we never use that. Let's instead use a Dictionary or a Set, so that lookup
of a particular element is pretty quick.

A dictionary maps a key to a value. A set can also hold "Items" which can just contain a key and value.
That's why they're the same ADT.
