A heap is a great way of ordering elements and implementing a Priority Queue
A Priority Queue has a couple of methods that are important: insert(), findMin(), delete()


Heap:
- A heap is structured in a way such that the top element is the smallest number
- In the case of the max heap, the top element is the largest number
- Every number below this node is greater (opposite for a max heap)


Insert:
- Insert at the next open spot in the heap (it's in the last row on the right)
- Then, you have to percolate up, which is when you reset the order of the Heap
- Percolate up:
  - while this node is greater than the parent node, switch this node with the parent node

FindMin:
- Just get the top element from a heap.

Delete:
- Usually done right after findMin, delete the element at the top
- replace it with the last element in the Heap
- then percolate down
  - while the current element is greater than either child
  - switch the current element with the smaller child
